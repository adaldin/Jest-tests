# Sprint 4 IT Academy - Video management tool | Testing with Jest

## Introduction

A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.

## Visuals
As part of the exercise the idea was to implement all loops in ES6 (using map, reduce, filter and sort to manipulate arrays) and to pass all the test just using ES6 and then, upload a picture of the coverage with all test passed.

## Tests!


```shell

And last, open the generated `test-results.html` file with the "Live Server" VSCode extension to see test results.
